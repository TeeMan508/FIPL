Unvaccinated people will be banned from accessing all but the most essential businesses,
such as supermarkets and pharmacies, to curb the spread of coronavirus, outgoing Chancellor
Angela Merkel and her successor, Olaf Scholz, announced Thursday, following crisis talks with regional leaders.
Those who have recently recovered from Covid-19 are not covered by the ban.
